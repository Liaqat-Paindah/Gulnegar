                                    Kamila Kiarang, the owner and founder of Golnegar Handicrafts, has an educational background in business and law. She got her Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration in 2018 from Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi University located in Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. She then went on to graduate from law faculty in 2020 from Khatam Khatam Al Nabieen University in Kabul. In addition to extensive educational background, she has a lot of work experience in teaching and media. Currently, she is working at the Opinion Research Center of Afghanistan (ORCA) in addition to managing her brand.

                                    Kamila established Golnegar Handicrafts in 2019. In the true entrepreneurial spirit, she manages operations related to Golnegar Handicrafts after her official work hours and on her off days. She works with a partner who manages the shop while she is away. There is also a full-time designer who designs all the clothing and other products. Of 70 employees, the majority are women who perform embroidery works from their homes. This means all of the products that the brand produces are completely handwoven and hand-embroidered by the hard-working women who embody the brand.
                                    
                                    Kamila was first motivated to start a handcrafted business through her knowledge of business and law education. She wished to be financially independent, which owning her own business would allow for. She appreciates handmade items but noticed that slowly fading away in mainstream culture due to competition with cheaply made products. Yet, she also realized there is still a large, global market and demand for handmade products, so she bravely began filling the niche market.
                    
                                    Aseel proudly partners with Golnegar Handicrafts and supports the brand’s vision of reviving the desire for handmade and handwoven products. The brand’s artisans produce stylish clothing including Hazaragi clothes, ceremonial and party wear dresses, modern clothes, and others. They also hand-sew products such as embroidered pillows and decorative items. Kamila hopes that her endeavors inspire the new generation to appreciate handmade crafts and products. By partnering with Aseel, Kamila believes her sales will increase and her products will get showcased around the world to anyone who adores and appreciates handmade products.
